### Weekly Plan

#### Day 1: Introduction to Text Preprocessing

**Tasks:**

- Install and set up Python libraries: `nltk`, `spacy`, `textblob`.
- Learn the basics of text cleaning:
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing URLs, numbers, and punctuation
- Write a script to clean a sample text.

**Resources:**

- [Text Preprocessing Guide (Analytics Vidhya)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/text-preprocessing-in-nlp-with-python-codes/)
- Hands-On:
  - Implement a text cleaning script using regular expressions.

#### Day 2: Tokenization

**Tasks:**

- Learn about word and sentence tokenization.
- Practice tokenization using NLTK and SpaCy.

**Resources:**

- [Understanding Tokenization](https://www.nltk.org)
- [NLTK Tokenization Documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html)
- [SpaCy Tokenization](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#tokenization)

**Hands-On:**

- Tokenize sentences and words from a dataset or sample text.
- Compare results from NLTK and SpaCy.
- [NLTK Implementation (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZvOKSCkxY&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDf2JswnfiGkliBInZnIC4HL)
- [SpaCy Implementation (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lR3RjvYvF4)

#### Day 3: Stop Words Removal

**Tasks:**

- Understand stopwords and their role in text preprocessing.
- Use NLTK and SpaCy to filter out stopwords.

**Resources:**

- [Stop Words](https://medium.com/@yashj302/stopwords-nlp-python-4aa57dc492af#:~:text=Stop%20words%20are%20common%20words%20in%20any%20language%20that%20occur,%2C%20were%2C%20is%2C%20not%20%E2%80%A6)
- [NLTK Stop words](https://pythonspot.com/nltk-stop-words/)
- [SpaCy Stop Words](https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching)

---

**Hands-On:**
- Remove stopwords from a dataset using NLTK and Spacy.

#### Day 4: Stemming and Lemmatization

**Tasks:**

- Learn the difference between stemming and lemmatization.
- Implement stemming using NLTK and lemmatization using SpaCy.

**Resources:**

- [Stemming and Lemmatization](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/text-preprocessing-in-nlp-with-python-codes/)
- [Spacy vs NLTK - Stemming and Lemmatization](https://devskrol.com/2021/11/28/spacy-stemming-vs-lemmatization/)


**Hands-On:**
- Apply stemming and lemmatization to the preprocessed text.
- Compare results and document observations.
